- Added stuff for automated curseforge builds (doesn't affect mod.)
- Added stuff for automated curseforge update checking with modupdater. It is advised to still use Modrinth for updates
  since it doesn't need to get approved first.

- Added more keybinds:
    - Weather (B key)
    - Time (N key)
    - Gamemode (M key)
